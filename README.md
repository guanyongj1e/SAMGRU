# Code for SA-MGRU: Gate-Aligned Fusion of Self-Attention and Multi-Gate GRU for Medical Image Segmentation

## Dataset 
In the case of 2D input, we evaluate the performance of our proposed modules on the following datasets:
The synapse dataset can be found at the [repo of TransUNet](https://github.com/Beckschen/TransUNet).
ISIC2018 dataset: This dataset focuses on the segmentation of skin lesions [link](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/landing/2018/).
In the case of 3D input, we evaluate the performance of our proposed modules on the following datasets:
CVC-ClinicDB dataset: This dataset pertains to polyp segmentation in colonoscopy videos and has been used for comparing automatic segmentation methods. [link](https://polyp.grand-challenge.org/CVCClinicDB/).
The ACDC dataset can be found at the [repo of MTUNet](https://github.com/Dootmaan/MT-UNet).
